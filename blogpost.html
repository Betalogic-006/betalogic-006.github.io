            <b>Science</b> (from the Latin word scientia, meaning "knowledge")[1] is
            a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form
            of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][3][4]
            The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and
            Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE.[5][6] Their contributions to
            mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural
            philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to
            provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural
            causes.[5][6] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of
            Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the
            early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages,[7] but was
            preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age.[8] The
            recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into
            Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural
            philosophy",[7][9] which was later transformed by the Scientific
            Revolution that began in the 16th century[10] as new ideas and
            discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and
            traditions.[11][12][13][14] The scientific method soon played a greater
            role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that
            many of the institutional and professional features of science began to
            take shape;[15][16][17] along with the changing of "natural philosophy"
            to "natural science."[18]
        </p><br>
        <p class="font2">
            Modern science is typically divided into three major branches[19] that
            consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics),
            which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g.,
            economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and
            societies;[20][21] and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics,
            and theoretical computer science), which deal with symbols governed by
            rules.[22][23] There is disagreement,[24][25][26] however, on whether
            the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on
            empirical evidence.[27][25] Disciplines that use existing scientific
            knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are
            described as applied sciences.[
        </p><br>
        <p class="font2">
            New knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are
            motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve
            problems.[33][34] Contemporary scientific research is highly
            collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research
            institutions,[35] government agencies, and companies.[36][37] The
            practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of science
            policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by
            prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health
            care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection.
